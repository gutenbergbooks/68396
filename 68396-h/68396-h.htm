<h2 class="nobreak">The Newly Wed.</h2>
</div></div>


<p>We will suppose you have read and profited
by the excellent suggestions contained in an
article published in a previous issue of this
library, under the head of “How to Woo, Win
and Wed.” You have succeeded in winning
the object of your affections, and have set sail
upon the sea of matrimony. It is often called
a troublous sea. Such indeed it proves in
truth to be for those who embark upon it not
fully prepared for the voyage. Do you really,
married or unmarried, know the full meaning
of the word marriage. It is something far
more serious than a mere civil contract or religious
ceremony. These are only the marks
of outward show. There is a good deal behind
these—a good deal that you ought to know,
and of which, perchance, you are ignorant.
The aim of this article is to give some practical
advice to those who have already entered
into the bonds of matrimony, and it will not, it
is hoped, come amiss to those about to marry,
but who have not yet taken the step that leads
to misery or bliss. “Marriage,” says Selden,
“is a desperate thing; the frogs in Æsop were
extremely wise; they had a great mind to some
water, but they would not leap into the well,
because they could not get out again.” Would
that most of us possessed the wisdom of the
fabled frogs.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Purpose of Marriage.</h2>
</div>


<p>Marriage ought to be consummated as the
result of mutual love and esteem, and not for
the purpose of simply gratifying the desires of
our lower nature. This last consideration is, it
must be acknowledged, a controlling one with
a great many people, and marriages contracted
in this manner are not generally, and cannot
hope to be, happy ones. The sacredness of the
marriage relation ought never to be violated.
We must not forget that we are rational beings
with a will to withstand the weaknesses of our
animal natures.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Happy and Unhappy Marriages.</h2>
</div>


<p>A happy marriage is without doubt the ideal
state of living, the end for which mankind has
always striven, while an unhappy marriage is
a veritable hell on earth. Examples of both
of these states need not be given. We see
them every day. To one who reads the daily
papers regularly with particular note of the
records of divorces, assaults of drunken or
jealous husbands, the faithlessness of women
and the elopements, the thought must present
itself that there are more unhappy marriages
than happy ones. This, fortunately, is not
true. Where we read of one unhappy marriage
and its terrible consequences there are
ten happy ones of which the world never hears.</p>

<p>“Marriage,” writes Addison, “enlarges the
scene of our happiness and miseries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>“It is a mistake,” says another writer, “to
consider marriage merely as a scheme to happiness;
it is also a bond of service, it is the
most ancient of that social ministration which
God has ordained for all human beings, and
which is symbolized by all the relations of
nature.”</p>

<p>Still another writer says: “Married life appears
to me a sort of philosophical discipline,
training persons to honorable duties, worthy
of the good and wise. Few unmarried people
are affected as they ought to be toward the
public good, and perceive what are really the
most important objects in life.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How to be Happy.</h2>
</div>


<p>Those who wish to lead happy married lives
cannot do better than to follow a few rules
which we present herewith.</p>

<p>Husband and wife ought to maintain entire
confidence in each other, have no secrets each
from the other; don’t quarrel; have forbearance
for each other’s failings; you have neither of
you married an angel. Remember, husband,
that of every dollar you own, fifty cents belongs
to your wife; she is an equal partner with you
in the business of life; don’t compel her to
become a mere household drudge, working for
her board and clothes; she did not marry you
for that. Try to see the good points of your
husband or wife; don’t magnify the faults;
we are all only human; don’t have the first
quarrel and the second will never come.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Golden Precepts.</h2>
</div>


<p>Let the rebuke be preceded by a kiss.</p>

<p>Don’t require a request to be repeated.</p>

<p>Never should both be angry at the same time.</p>

<p>Be lovers all your life. Let the courtship be
continued after marriage.</p>

<p>Never neglect the other for all the world beside.</p>

<p>Let each strive always to accommodate the
other.</p>

<p>Let the angry word be answered with a kiss.</p>

<p>Bestow your warmest sympathies in each
other’s trials.</p>

<p>Criticize as little as possible, but if you find
it necessary to criticize, make your criticism in
the most loving manner possible.</p>

<p>Make no display of the sacrifices you make
for each other.</p>

<p>Never make remarks calculated to bring
ridicule upon the other.</p>

<p>Never deceive; confidence once lost can never
be wholly regained.</p>

<p>Always use the most loving and gentle
words when addressing each other.</p>

<p>Let each study what pleasure he can bestow
upon the other during the day.</p>

<p>Always leave home with a tender good-bye
and loving words. They may be the last.</p>

<p>Consult and advise together in all things.</p>

<p>When you feel like quarrelling, discuss the
whole thing together and you will come to an
amicable settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Never reproach the other, especially in the
presence of others, for an error which was committed
with a good motive and with the best
judgment at the time.</p>

<p>Don’t tell your friends the faults of your husband
or wife.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Duty of the Wife.</h2>
</div>


<p>The wife’s place is in the home. That is her
proper sphere of action, and the one in which
she ought to be most happy.</p>

<p>Don’t devote time to society matters while
your house duties need to be done. Don’t
spend your time in making clothes for some
naked boys in Dooloboo who do not need
them, while your own children go about with
patched or torn clothing.</p>

<p>Greet your husband with a smile on his
return from work.</p>

<p>Don’t scold your husband.</p>

<p>Don’t think your husband ought to be perfect.
Are you yourself perfect?</p>

<p>Be careful and economical in the expenditure
of money for household purposes. (By the
way, your husband ought to make you the
treasurer of the firm.)</p>

<p>Always dress neatly for your husband’s
sake. You used to do it before marriage. Imagine
your husband is still your lover.</p>

<p>Treat your husband’s friends politely. This
is an important part of your wifely duty.</p>

<p>Don’t spend money extravagantly for dress
or other personal adornment.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Husband’s Duty.</h2>
</div>


<p>Don’t think the woman you have married is
yours, body and soul.</p>

<p>Don’t be niggardly in money matters.</p>

<p>Don’t withhold from your wife your tender
love and sympathy. Regard her as your dear
sweetheart all through life. Always treat her
with tender consideration.</p>

<p>Don’t try to argue with her. A woman cannot
reason; she is guided rather by her
womanly intuition, which is rarely at fault.</p>

<p>Follow the counsel of your wife. Many a
man has done so and succeeded. Wisdom and
foresight are possessed by women, as well as
men.</p>

<p>Let your wife understand fully your business.
Don’t let her think you are earning
fifty dollars a week when you are earning only
thirty dollars, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Give your wife all the pleasure you can.
She needs it.</p>

<p>Do not go about enjoying yourself with boon
companions while your wife toils at home.</p>

<p>Don’t spend money for rum while your wife
has to make over her old dresses.</p>

<p>If your wife is worthy of it (most wives are),
praise her. Women like praise.</p>

<p>Women are not as strongly built as men, and
are thus likely to be often in delicate health.
If so, your wife may be petulant and cross.
Make allowances for this and don’t scold her.</p>

<p>Don’t interfere with your wife in the performance
of the duties that belong peculiarly to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Give her money enough to dress well, even
if you have to make sacrifices to do so.</p>

<p>Treat her mother with becoming respect.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Marrying for a Home.</h2>
</div>


<p>A good many women are foolish enough and
dishonorable enough to marry merely for a
home—foolish because they cannot expect such
a marriage to result happily, and dishonorable
because they have deceived the man they
married. Love ought to be the basis of all
marriages.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Joy and Pleasure.</h2>
</div>


<p>A married life is not one of unalloyed bliss.
We ought not to expect this. It has its pains
as well as its pleasures. As Margaret Fuller
says: “Deceive not thyself by over-expecting
happiness in the marriage state; look not
therein for contentment greater than God will
give, or a creature in this world can receive,
namely, to be free from all inconveniences.
Marriage is not, like the hill of Olympus,
wholly clear without clouds.” When misfortune
comes to us, and all the rest of the world
deserts us, we have those at home to whom to
look in certain expectancy of sympathy and
encouragement—wife and children. As John
Taylor says: “A married man falling into misfortune
is more apt to retrieve his situation in
the world than a single one, chiefly because his
spirits are soothed and retrieved by domestic
endearments, and his self-respect kept alive by<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
finding that, although all abroad be darkness
and humiliation, yet there is a little world of
love at home over which he is monarch.”</p>

<p>A married man is more apt to labor for the
good of all mankind, while a single man is apt
to be more selfish in his aims and endeavors.
The interests of a single man centre round himself,
while those of a married man embrace his
whole family, and in a larger degree the whole
community.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Don’t Board.</h2>
</div>


<p>If you are a newly-married couple, don’t
board. Go to keeping house as soon as possible.
Don’t get married if you can’t do this.
A young woman ought to learn the duties and
pleasures of housekeeping as soon after marriage
as possible. If she boards out, she has
little to occupy her time, and is apt to pass her
days in reading silly novels, or to fall into that
terrible habit of gossiping. She ought to find
pleasure in working for her husband, and she
can work for him best only in her own home,
preparing his meals and by the performance of
other wifely duties. As a mere boarder in
somebody else’s home, she cannot do this.
There are many drawbacks and perplexities
about housekeeping, to be sure, but these
ought to be met and contended with with a
brave spirit. In the end, having conquered, it
will be found that the pleasures far outweigh
them. A woman ought to take pleasure in
looking after the home nest, and ought not to<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
leave to some unsympathetic boarding-housekeeper
the task of preparing the daily meals for
her husband.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Mother-in-Law.</h2>
</div>


<p>A mother-in-law is often a blessing, but few
will admit the truth of this statement. Many
men, however, have found her to be a ministering
angel in disguise. It is better, nevertheless,
for the newly-married couple to live by themselves,
if possible, and not be under the sway
of a mother-in-law, or other relative, however
kind and unselfish she or they may be. They
ought to strike out for themselves. A mother-in-law,
however good her intention may be
(and no doubt her intentions are always good),
is pretty sure to prove meddlesome and dictatorial
to a greater or less degree, and end by
being an element of discord in what ought to
be a happy home. You will find it better to
paddle your own canoe, even if you do not
make very rapid or easy progress at first.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Marriage a Lottery.</h2>
</div>


<p>Marriage has been called a lottery. Fortunately
it is a lottery in which there are a
great many prizes. Let us give you this bit of
advice in regard to marriage as a lottery: Try
to think that you have drawn a prize. Thinking
so will go a good way toward making the
supposition a pleasant reality. Never lose
sight of this fact. If your husband or wife
does not come up to the high standard which<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
you have hoped for, try to stifle the disappointment.
It might be worse. Start out well on
the sea of matrimony. “Many a marriage,”
writes Frederika Bremer, “has commenced
like the morning, red, and perished like a
mushroom. Wherefore? Because the married
pair neglected to be as agreeable to each
other after their union as they were before it.
Seek always to please each other; lavish not
your love to-day; remember that marriage has
a morrow, and again a morrow.” Another
writer on the same subject wisely says: “The
happiness of married life depends on a power
of making small sacrifices with readiness and
cheerfulness. Few persons are ever called
upon to make great sacrifices or to confer great
favors; but affection is kept alive, and happiness
secured, by keeping up a constant warfare
against little selfishness.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Jealousy.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is said that jealousy is an unmistakable
sign of true love. We are supposed to be jealous
of those whom we most dearly love.
There may be some truth in this assertion, but
we incline rather to think that it is open to dispute.
Only the weakest are the most jealous.
But the “green-eyed” monster has caused too
much misery to treat the matter lightly.
Where mutual love and respect and perfect
confidence exist, and where the married parties
are sensible, intellectual people, jealousy rarely
exists. Jealousy, such as that which is said to<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
be an infallible sign of true love, is exhibited
chiefly by silly young women, married and
single, who have no serious grounds for suspicion
against the object toward which their jealousy
is directed. If you are of an incurably
jealous disposition, never marry any one of the
opposite sex who is good looking. This will
only add fuel to the fires of your jealousy.
Marry a homely person—the homelier the better—one
who is not likely to receive undesirable
attentions from the opposite sex after
marriage. But the best advice of all is don’t
be jealous. Be sensible. Nine times out of
ten you have no real cause for jealousy after
all. To be jealous of your husband or wife
implies that you have married a partner who
cannot be trusted. Have you married such a
person? Probably not. Then why be jealous?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Mental and Physical Exercise.</h2>
</div>


<p>People in ill health cannot be expected to be
happy whether they are married or single. In
order to preserve the health of mind and body,
the laws of health, as regards pure air, exercise,
food, drink, etc., must be rigidly followed.</p>

<p>Exercise is one of the best means of preserving
health. Care must be taken, however,
that the exercise be of a kind and amount suitable
to the needs of each person. Recreation,
or a change of occupation (but never idleness),
is sufficient exercise for some people. But
there is little recreation in a game of chess, for<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
instance, in the case of a man employed in a
counting-room all day. His exercise should be
taken out of doors, and be such as to free the
mind from the exactions of business. The
wealthy idler will find health in industry of
some kind. Horseback riding is beneficial for
those engaged in sedentary occupations, such
as bookkeeping, office-work, etc. Walking is
the best kind of exercise of all, and the most
easily obtainable. Bicycle riding, too, is very
good; so are all open-air games when not indulged
in to excess. Dancing is an agreeable
and healthy recreation for those engaged in
sedentary pursuits. Indeed, it is considered
second to none. One of the worse cases of consumption
has been known to have been cured
by dancing, practised daily for many months.
Horseback riding is also very good for consumptives.
Swimming is one of the best
kinds of exercise.</p>

<p>All but babies have too little sleep. Everybody
ought to get at least eight hours’ sleep in
a day. Insanity often results from want of
sleep. Always sleep on the right side, never
on the back. Always breathe through the
nose when asleep or awake. Never have a fire
in your sleeping-room, unless you are an invalid.
The need of cleanliness, pure air, pure
water, sunshine and a cheerful disposition, etc.,
are too well known to need insisting upon
here. These are necessary for the preservation
of health, and without health there can be
no real happiness.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp50" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i14.jpg" alt="Ventriloquist." />
</div>

<p>This great book was
written by the celebrated
Frederic Maccabe, one
of the most famous of the
world’s ventriloquists.
Mr. Maccabe here clearly
shows that ventriloquism
is not a natural gift, but
that by training and practice
it may be acquired
by any one, and it is certainly
an accomplishment
well worth cultivating,
for nothing will so amuse
and mystify a social gathering
as the feats of the
ventriloquist. He appears
to be a man of a dozen
voices. In his natural
tone of voice he asks a
question, and the answer
appears to come from the
depths of the chimney in the weak accents of a little
child. Again, we hear the voice of an old man appearing
to proceed from the roof of the building, the distant
barking of a dog, etc., etc. These wonderful imitations
are performed without the slightest movement of the
lips, greatly to the astonishment of the audience. Would
you not like to acquire this amusing and mystifying accomplishment?
You can do so easily and readily by
studying the directions contained in this book, which is
the best and most complete instructor in the art of ventriloquism
ever published. It is a book of 64 large, double-column
pages, bound in attractive colored paper
covers, and will be sent by mail post-paid upon receipt
of only <b>Ten Cents</b>.</p>
